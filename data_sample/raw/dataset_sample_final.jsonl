It has a more upscale look and feel to it, plus adds a battery gauge to show the charge level. However, the shave quality is the same \u2013 OK, but not a standout.<br /><br />The case feels more solid than the LifeProof and, while it\u2019s more of a traditional look, I think they did a nice job with the overall aesthetics. It is pretty grippy even with wet hands. It does not, however, feel as comfortable to hold as the more sculpted models such as most of the Panasonic shavers and some Braun shavers.<br /><br />The shave quality of this model is identical to that of the LifeProof: very Remington in how it feels (close, but rather aggressive). Performance is best on the easy spots (cheek) but not as good on the more trickier spots (neck and jawline). The flex head helps with dealing with face contours but it lacks enough travel to do an excellent quality job.<br /><br />The aggressiveness of the shave is dialed down when using it wet. It needs a very, very thin layer of shave cream (the gel style creams work well) or the head gets bogged down.<br /><br />Love the trimmer! The positioning could be improved to make it easier to use, but it cuts very cleanly on sideburns and \u2018shash trimming.<br /><br />The controls are clean, easy to read and tell you all you need to know (charge and battery status).<br /><br />I like the feel of this better than the Wahl LifeProof, but the shave quality keeps this at the same rating (average, which is 3 stars).

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The best.", "text": "After having used this product for a month, I find myself hooked.  As YMMV when taking someone's word on shave gear, I thought I might provide some background about me:  I have gentle to oily skin and stiff, tough neck hairs.  I used to think I had sensitive skin until I married someone with actual sensitive skin.  But the combination of the tough hairs and the gentleness of my skin leads to irritation on the neck when I am not careful.  I learned to shave with a gillette adjustable years ago(which I still use), but out of &#34;convenience&#34; (really, a lack of good shaving products and knowhow) I stopped using it for cartridge systems in my early twenties.  Since I started shaving right, some time ago, I got an EJ-89 which I use when I'm feeling raw, and an old type open comb gillette (which, for the moment at least, I favor for its closeness- I use personna lab blue blades or sharper in it).  I've tried a number of different soaps and a few creams, most of which are good.  Mitchell's is excellent.  It has a simple, clean smell like fresh linen and is the most thoroughly hydrating shaving product I have ever used.  It lathers up easily-  I've used my beat up old drugstore boar brush which is now probly 15 years old and a silvertip badger brush.. In either case, the lather whips up in a minute or less with no complications.  I'm not one of these people that soaks the puck either, I just heat it up in its dish, in a basin of hot water as I soak my brush and it is good to go.  I've heard that water hardness and temp can make a difference with this stuff, but as I have decidedly soft water here in the city, I can't really comment on that.  But once you get the lather right, with enough water, it is eaaasy on the face.  Amazing even..  I dreamt wetshaving was like this as a teenager..<br />  One might be put off by the price which may seem hefty for a newcomer to the wetshaving game, eager to start saving money (previously lost on walking the cartridge treadmill) and reticent to buy apparently expensive luxury shaving soaps, but aside from being a quality product, It lasts for a quite a while.  I was really going to wait until I had exhausted mine to write this review but it's been a month, and the puck looks basically the same size!  Growing up on Williams soap and favoring Van der Hagen as a drugstore standby these days, I notice one soap generally lasts me a month (some less than that), but aside from the simply larger size of Mitchells (4.4 oz to 2.5 oz for standard mug size soaps), you just get more bang for your buck.  I'm guessing this one will last me three months or more.. So at that rate, the price basically factors out altogether.<br />  To sum up, if you have gentle or easily irritated skin and aren't looking for a heavily scented product, this is the grail of soaps for you.  One word:  I wouldn't spring for the dish because I am cheap.  You might not be.. But the soap itself does perfectly fit a rice bowl or large ramekin, in case you were wondering.. Probably not a mug though, unless it were seriously oversized..", "images": [], "asin": "B001LY7FRK", "parent_asin": "B001LY7FRK", "user_id": "AGUGTCTCOHWX27GP4HY7DXJWA42A", "timestamp": 1403078776000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}

I used mine in the microwave, and it worked really well.<br /><br />They have a unique design, which is basically a plastic hand wrapper that has a spongy interior, and the sponge holds all of the paraffin wax so that it delivers it right to your hands.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great argan oil", "text": "It's a big bottle, 4 oz is a lot of argan oil considering how little you need of it.<br /><br />I use it for<br />cuticles<br />deep conditioning<br />a hair serum before flat ironing (just 2 drops!)<br />mixing with essential oils I use argan as the carrier oil<br />massage oil<br /><br />For those who came here looking for it for your hair, as a deep conditioning you would want to apply it to dry hair and to the ends only, unless you have a dry scalp, then you can apply to your scalp. You can leave it in as long as you want, and wrap your hair in saran wrap for an even more intense conditioning. When you have a good idea of how much to use, you can do it on damp hair. You can mix with coconut oil if you want the benefits of both. Wash it out with a good lathering shampoo after.<br /><br />If you want to use it as a leave in, I recommend just two drops applied to the ends and then the fly aways. I put the drops in my palm and rub my hands together and apply just 2 drops. Unless you have really thick hair you don't really need more. This will leave you with really soft, silky, shiny hair that is not greasy.<br /><br />I got a coupon to try this product out for a huge discount in order to provide feedback and an honest review.

I didn't want a mat - to me, they are too thick and get grimmey/slimey around the suction cups. This was a fun print that is also a good alternative. I had to buy 2 packs (I bought 1 turtle and 1 penguin pack) so there would be enough to fit my standard sized tub.<br /><br />Pros: The colors are vibrant and don't quickly fade (I am writing this review almost 2 months after purchase/install... 2-3 showers are taken daily in the tub where these are located). These stuck easily and have adhered nicely - they have not moved or lifted (i put these in when the tub was clean and dry). My toddler likes that there are animals in the tub. The no-slip surface isn't too rough and it does prevent slips!<br /><br />Cons: I just wish there were more in a package - I had to buy 2 packs which wasn't the worst thing because I was able to get a 2nd print. A variety pack would also have been nice with a few different animal prints instead of all one print but I still love this purchase!<br /><br />Did you find this review helpful?

Everyone seems to really love this cream according to all the reviews I saw on the internet. It is creamy and light and feels great when you first put it on.  Just one important thing the reviews don't tell you - after a short time,the cream will begin to \"ball up\" on the face if you wear it under makeup. Fine for going to bed but give it an hour so it doesn't come off on the pillow.  Nowhere have I seen anything about it balling up mentioned, so I am only giving you a heads up on the fact that it does this.  Otherwise, it does moisturize your skin very well and will last a long while during the day if you don't wear makeup over it.  When I am home, I usually apply after my shower and wear no makeup.

I also liked how this wasn't dripping with ampoule, it had the perfect amount to soak the face without it making a mess on your countertop or where the stuff would be rolling down your face and to your chest or creeping towards your eyes. So that in turn made wearing this more relaxing and not so irritating and awkward like most if not all the other sheet masks I tried. I almost didn't want to remove it, that's how much I enjoyed and loved it! I couldn't believe how baby soft smooth my skin was after using it. It wasn't a life-changer or game-changer for my hyperpigmentation, but it's unrealistic and next to impossible for any product to do that after only one use. My skin loved this though, I can tell that this is perfect for my skin type (combination/oily acne prone skin). I thought I'd swore off sheet masks.

I read all of the reviews and noted some of the negatives like noise and the fact that the shaver doesn't \"vaccum\" all of the whiskers.  I must say I haven't seen much of these negatives.  The trimmer works great and beats my old Braun which did not collect whiskers.  I would say that 90% of the whiskers are collected in the compartment rather than on my bathroom counter.  The noise in my opinion is to be expected given the cutting and vacuum action being performed.  I especially like the carrying case and accessory trimmer that are included with this model.  The only negative I have noted is that the trimmer settings are not real precise.  If I want a real clean look I have to go all the way down to the lowest setting and my goatee needs trimming about every 3 days.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great shave and great warranty", "text": "In reading the comments I noticed that almost no one compared different shavers.<br />I have used a Norelco for years but I wanted something that was better and quicker to use on a two or three day beard.  I have a Philips Norelco 4500.  I bought the Wahl Smart Shave and the Braun 3040s.<br />After a two week trial I came up with the following observations.<br />On all three the blades float so they stay close to the face as you shave.<br />On the Norelco and the Wahl the head swivels too.  It\u2019s nice but I would not miss it if it were not there.<br />The Norelco is smoother and quieter than the other two.  It is also the easiest to clean.  It only takes one hand. Norelco recommends (and it is true) that saving in a circular motion works the best with their shaver.<br />The Norelco and the Wahl have Lithium batteries.  The Braun has an NiMH battery.  I like the Lithium.<br />I think the Wahl and the Braun shave closer than the Norelco but they are all close.<br />As for the trimmers, they all cut about the same.  I would not buy a shaver without it. The Wahl is harder to manipulate.  It has a nice metallic finish but that makes it hard to move up or down.  It slips under your thumb.<br />The Wahl has the better battery and charge level indicator and a five year warranty. Wahl replacement head and blades are not on Amazon now.  The Braun blades are easier to replace and the part is available on Amazon. Norelco blades are also easy to replace and available on Amazon.<br />I like all three shavers.

I purchased this lovely Crystal Bridal Comb with an Elegant Scroll Design from my favorite online jeweler, Mariell. This bridal comb is stunning, and just perfect for updos or to catch a section of hair to accent. This beautiful, vintage looking hair comb measures 4 inches wide and is 2 \u00bc inches high. It\u2019s just the right size to make a statement without taking away from the beauty of the bride. This comb has top quality, European crystals set in a vintage scroll motif that offers an easy, classic, never-goes-out-of-style appearance. The comb also arrives in a lovely gift box, ready to give to someone special in your life. This would be so pretty for weddings, proms, formal events and special parties. I would not limit this to weddings. It\u2019s just too pretty to wear only one time. Also, this gorgeous comb should last for years of use with proper care. It should be stored in a dust free location and it should not be worn during swimming or bathing. It can be wiped clean with a soft cloth and an alcohol pad, if necessary. If you do this, the brilliance and shine will come back every time and this will greatly increase the lifespan of this precious piece of jewelry.

There's a strong alcohol scent to it, but that's expected. The stronger the alcohol, the more likely it'll remove tough nail polishes. Oh, but it also messes up the fingers more too. Dry, cracked, white powder, and so on on the nails. Eeek! The only problem I can honestly say is that after removing the nail polishes too many times, the nail polish stays on the sponge. It's so hard to clean it! Maybe add extra sponges for the remover next time? I know that I can buy my own sponges and put it inside too, but it's going to be be hard having to find the perfect fit sponge. I still like this remover though.

It's easy to change between temperatures and the unit heats up incredibly quickly, which is awesome.<br /><br />The downside to this is that the design makes it more difficult to lay down on the counter - if you have a sink that is slightly raised then you can prop it up against that, but I do wish it had something like some of the curling irons have.  It also comes with a small bag, but I'm slightly worried about putting the straightener in the bag if it's even slightly warm, as it's the type of material that could melt easily.<br /><br />I'm not really familiar with straighteners in general, but this does seem like it's designed to be similar to some of the more name brand, expensive items out there.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not quite my grandfather's shaving brush", "text": "My maternal grandfather passed away some 40 years ago. After my mother returned from her out-of-state trip to be with her mother and bury her father, she gave me a small box containing some of his personal belongings. Among them was his Ever Ready PBT300 shaving brush. I had no use for it at the time. As I unpacked after a recent move I rediscovered this item and decided to use it. It was really enjoyable, so after a few months I decided granddad's brush should be properly retired and I should get my own. Since they no longer manufacture Ever Ready's, I looked here at Amazon. This was the brush I decided upon. It's ok.<br /><br />It is definitely NOT my grandfather's brush - quality-wise. Grand dad was a farmer, and not a gentleman farmer. So he would not have paid a lot for his. So I thought this one might be similar in quality. I was wrong. It's very stiff. It does not do a great job with the soap lather. It also arrived with a very strong, musky aroma in the bristles. This is probably what badgers smell like. But as I am a native of southern California and we don't need no stinkin' badgers here, I am not positive. This aroma was also transferred to my face as well, for the first month of use. Just prior to the musky animal aroma disappearing, I was frustrated enough with the smell on me all day to look for another brush. Since my grandfather's brush had no aroma I knew it was possible to have one that was aroma - free. But was it a matter of quality or simply a matter of time?<br /><br />I purchased a $70 Vulfix brush, hand-made on the Isle of Man in the UK.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />It is much more like granddad's in color, feel, and use. It lathers very nicely. It's very soft on the face. It holds a lot of water. There was a slight smell (nothing at all like the SimplyBeautiful smell)that was gone after the 2nd use. If you are thinking about going with a shaving brush (and I LOVE mine and will only go back to the can for short travel trips), my advice is to spend the money and get one that will last for a few decades (like the Vulfix) and avoid the \"badgery\" smell - although it did eventually go away. I haven't made the decision to also go with the straight razor. I figure I will give the EMTs in the area a break and stick with the safety razor.....", "images": [], "asin": "B0045QGYNM", "parent_asin": "B0045QGYNM", "user_id": "AE23W52LQYC5YMO2EUDRPEXKPGPQ", "timestamp": 1299112684000, "helpful_vote": 13, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Helps My Sensitive Skin", "text": "My skin is ridiculously sensitive, so finding products that won't set off some kind of irritation, breakouts, etc., is nearly impossible. I hadn't used a cica cream before, but the reviews were positive enough that I wanted to give it a try.<br /><br />The texture is interesting - it's less a cream and more like a gel that's almost runny. It absorbs fairly quickly into the skin and doesn't leave behind any kind of greasy residue. It does help with redness and dry patches, and at this point, it doesn't seem to cause breakouts.<br /><br />I have to say, though, that I was hoping for longer-lasting, even cumulative results, because I apply this at night and right after I rinse my face off the next morning, it's almost like I never used the product at all. Maybe it's a matter of me having to use this twice a day (at least), but given the high price point for what is, in fact, a pretty small tube of product, I feel like I would go through the cream much too quickly that way.<br /><br />Still, it does help a bit and doesn't seem to cause any issues, so this is one of the very few products that I can see myself continuing to use long-term.", "images": [], "asin": "B0859CYSTM", "parent_asin": "B0859CYSTM", "user_id": "AEJGPGKNBKOSQMQI5AOBVQNQOJTA", "timestamp": 1595712630110, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

I\u2019m glad the post office didn\u2019t hold it or penalize Me at least.<br />First impression, love the heart. Very surprised that so much quality went into that and then the interior was just so cheap. Stacked nozzles that don\u2019t stay together, a base that isn\u2019t secure, and not a snug fit: one cat outburst and this things caput! Inside is a small container but it lasted a few hours more than I expected, although with the one hole, you can\u2019t tell that you\u2019re even diffusing anything unless you use a whole bottle of oil. It\u2019s just too little being dispersed which is probably why it lasts longer. I like the concept, even my kids said it was cool, but def needs better construction to stabilize and make max use of the product.<br /><br />Update- I took the extenders off and just use the base and it disperses the smell much better. It also lasted about twelve hours which was surprising for such a small vessel. I\u2019m still taking off a Star bc of the cheap base. For the heart quality, there needs to be something not only more aesthetically pleasing but safer.<br /><br />Update -3 weeks later and it no longer works. We aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s the base or the cord. We tried everything in our end w sev outlets and USB boxes so we know it\u2019s not ours. Asking company to send a new cord. I really don\u2019t want to return it but I bought it for use, not decoration..<br />I emailed the seller and they had us ship back the base-they refunded postage and we had a new base in less than a week.

I did have to sew in a clip in the back/base for better secure fit but I don\u2019t mind doing that.

It\u2019s airing out right now and I hardly notice any smell 1 hour later.

Idk if I can see this particular shade working well with different skin tones but I\u2019m neutral and I\u2019m liking it. 3rd picture is the wig immediately after removing it from package and it actually was \u201cwiggy\u201d when seeing it in the sunlight.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Surprising Find", "text": "I got this today and tried it out right away. I only had a couple minutes and was happy to discover it blends quickly and easily. I\u2019m fussy about makeup and don\u2019t like the look of anything too obvious. After initial application I used my hands to gently wipe away excess and help it melt into the skin, it made a big difference. As an aside, it was very difficult to wash off my hands so I suspect it won\u2019t transfer all over the place. It lives up to its name and imparts a lovely glow but doesn\u2019t look oily or greasy. So far I\u2019ve had it on for five hours and it still looks pretty good. I did spray my face with a bit of water and blotted with a tissue. That really smoothed the areas that we\u2019re looking a bit dry. I need to swap to a heavier winter moisturizer and and had done no skin prep prior to application. Given that I can\u2019t judge this too harshly.<br /><br />As to the shade, it\u2019s not prefect but close. I wear Cream in Hourglass Vanish foundation. I think that makes me close to NW15-20 in MAC. I feel like the cool tone version of 21 would work better, but this one is neutral enough I can make it work. A lot of times neutrals lean too warm but this one doesn\u2019t seem too which means it\u2019ll work for more people. I think depth wise it\u2019s okay, but If you\u2019re at all darker than me get the next shade up.<br /><br />At under $13 this is pretty incredible. It doesn\u2019t come with a refill, but given the price I\u2019m not going to complain.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A high-quality soap with great aroma, foaming and cleansing that I plan to use quite often", "text": "Review of:  TCM Men's Cleansing Activated Charcoal Bar Soap - For all skin types - 5oz (1 Pack)<br /><br />In the handful of times that I\u2019ve used the TCM Charcoal Bar Soap I\u2019ve noticed a number of items that I\u2019ve been really pleased to experience.<br /><br />The first is the size of the bar; no wimpy sliver of soap here.  The bar right around 3 inches in length, 1 \u00be inches wide and 1 \u00bd inches tall.  A size big enough that, until I used the soap enough times to round off the edges, the size was almost too large to hold easily using just one hand.<br /><br />A second, immediately noticeable, item was the smell.  Not a sweet smell but more of a slight, dusky, flower-like aroma that, for me at least, was super nice.  Perhaps, in it\u2019s own way, as nice an aroma as I\u2019ve found with any bar of soap.<br /><br />The amazing amount of lather this bar gives off was another pleasant surprise, far more than I had expected from something that doesn\u2019t fit into the \u2018body-wash\u2019 category.  When washing my face, I only need to rub the bar in my hands a couple of times and then when the soap is rubbed onto my face the suds really start forming.  The lather is impressive, especially compared to other \u2018cleansing\u2019 bars I\u2019ve used before.<br /><br />The charcoal, or maybe it\u2019s some other ingredient, does seem to do a nice job of cleaning my face, especially after I\u2019ve applied sun screen earlier in the day.  Sun screen, in my experience, soaks into my skin really deeply and is almost like a magnet in attracting dirt, and many \u2018regular\u2019 soaps simply don\u2019t seem to cut through the grim.  The TCM soap, however, removes any embedded dirt and also does away with the slick feeling the sun screen leaves on my face.  noticed that many cleaning soaps especially after washing my face.<br /><br />On the other-side-of-the-coin, however, I\u2019ve noticed that the TCM Charcoal Bar Soap leaves my skin drier than I expected; for me there was no real sense of having any moisturizing left on my face after washing.  This dryness was apparent to me as, after washing, my face was almost too dry to be able to comfortably use my electric razor.  Still, while that was a surprise to me I don\u2019t consider the dryness to be a major concern compared to the cleaning benefits the soap gives.<br /><br />All-in-all, the TCM Charcoal Bar is a high-quality soap that I plan to use quite often.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please click the Helpful button", "images": [], "asin": "B0845LNDJK", "parent_asin": "B0845LNDJK", "user_id": "AGQIAEHZCIQ4F5O6TKP6YJA6V63Q", "timestamp": 1602268976374, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Fairly inexpensive 100% remy hair, however, they don't really last more than two-weeks.", "text": "I've been purchasing these extensions for the past year.  I continued purchasing them after the first time because they ARE 100% remy hair and I've paid more than what these cost with other sellers claiming that their extensions were 100% remy hair when actually they appeared to be part Barbie hair and real hair.  This is the reason I am giving this seller a 4 star.  However,  after a year of purchasing these, I am trying out a new seller (even lower price and 62% 5 star rating) because of the following reasons:<br /><br />1.  These extensions are very thin at the ends.<br />2.  The ends require trimming as they appear to already be splitting when you receive them (so you have to make certain you order a length longer than you want to leave room for trimming).<br />3.  The tape is really bad.  However, this is not a reason I would never order from this seller again.  I typically take the original tape off and replace them with better tape before I put them in.<br />4.  No matter what type of shampoo/conditioner I use (sulfate free) or how often I wash my hair (twice a week), these extensions get dry/brittle/frizzy very quickly.  And I do use Chi heat protectant prior to blow drying & flat ironing.<br />5.  I consider myself in the mid-stages of DIY (I watch YouTube videos to find out how other DIY hair extension users prolong the use of the hair extensions, etc.), however, no matter what measures I take to keep them in my hair for more than two-weeks, I am still spending too much time and effort on the upkeep and replacing the tapes and putting them back in.<br />6.  According to the description, these extensions are treated with a shed-free treatment to keep them from shedding, however, these extensions shed a lot.  Obviously, if they are brittle/frizzy, they are going to break off.<br /><br />I wanted to wait until I had purchased these extensions multiple times before writing my review so that I would be able to post a fair and honest review.  Also, when I first started purchasing these, I was a newby at putting in and replacing hair extensions.  And this review does not mean that I will never purchase these extensions from this seller again.  They do have a good return policy that I could have used.  Prior to purchasing from this seller, I had purchased hair extensions that were very expensive that I will never purchase from again.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great...BUT Beware of Size Issues", "text": "EDIT - I wrote the review below and then I realized that each page has it's specific style AND varied SIZES.  I didn't realize this at first.  This fact alone will lead me to not buy them again.  It's common to mess up on ONE brow in a pair.  Its nice to be able to go to your page and just cut off a new one and not worry if it's the same size as the others.  I only like the bigger (longer) brows, so I won't even want to use half the brows on each page.  Major issue for me.  I'll leave the tips below, because if you don't care about size differences, maybe this info will help you.<br /><br />1-  They are overall amazing!<br />2-  They take some practice, but it's worth it.<br />3-  When I mess up, I remove them with alcohol and toilet tissue.  I wet it with alcohol and rub with dry toilet tissue.  The dry helps rub the transfer off.  It's not super pleasant, but it works.<br />5-  They last for me for two full days.<br />6-  As crazy as it sounds, I followed the advice of someone here and shaved my (small) brows after trying to apply over my natural brows.  I was very freaked out about shaving my brows, but my brows sucked anyhow and it improved the look of these by far!<br />7-  My advice is to try all or almost all of the varieties sent in the package.  It can't hurt to try, right?!  Remember you can always remove them if you really can't stand them. Some of the ones that looked very odd on paper, looked not bad on me!  Some look better on \"natural\" days and some look better with make-up.  I wear the ones I don't hate on days I'm just staying home and I save my favs for the days I go out.<br />8-  The eyebrow print is on the front AND the back, so you can hold them up in the mirror to place correctly.  Super helpful.<br />9-  Again, overall these look very natural!  To eliminate the shiny look they can have a little brush of power foundation works, but I have found that a little water splashed on my face after helps too.", "images": [], "asin": "B088FLBYWT", "parent_asin": "B088FLBYWT", "user_id": "AGLWDKGJ4UTDYJTHQQRXHQLN22UQ", "timestamp": 1599447669377, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

I had on silver and used this over it.  It was fun and festive.  Great for a party.  THEN I tried it over a black base coat and WOW it was so cute.  My nails looked just like the seller photos.  A few tips that worked for me:  I found that letting my base coat still be a little tacky, not completely dry, helped the sparkles grab better instead of sliding towards the tip.  I used the part of the wand before the brush to drop sparkles in blank spots.  Also, I swirled the brush around in the center of the bottle to get the best coat of sparkles on the brush before applying.  The finish was surprisingly smooth after I applied a top coat. There is only one drawback....it is a very thick polish and takes quite a while to dry even with quick dry top coat and drops.  Be prepared to spend some time.  It's not an every day polish for me but I love it when I take the time.

The Brushegg is a great addition to the set, too, and is worth like $5-10 alone.  I held it in the palm of my hand and used a gentle shampoo, rubbed the brushes across the grooves in a circular motion, and my brushes washed very easily and thoroughly.

Then I consume the tea and the 'used' Hibiscus flower (to get all the antioxidants and organic compounds). This is the same Hibiscus flower that is dried and in powder form. So, using it to make beverages or in cooking is much easier.<br />I very much appreciate that the label displays two very important certifications/badges: USDA Organic and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices). These two labels demonstrate the attention and commitment to the purity and integrity of the ingredients and processing. These two certifications check off critical boxes for me.<br />I added this powder to a smoothie, turing it a deep pink, which is a trademark of Hibiscus flower. I like the flavor of Hibiscus, perhaps due to drinking it somewhat regularly.  When used in a smoothie, i found the other ingredients dominated the flavor, which is fine. I'm still getting the health benefits of the Hibiscus.<br />I am amazed that it can be used for a face mask, skin care and hair treatment. Personally, I'll take advantage of this powdered form for adding to smoothies/drinks and into cooking recipes. It acts an excellent organic, natural red coloring for baked goodies.<br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product. It is exactly as described and shown in the product details.

In the box was a charming little cloth satchel and in it was the Polish.<br /><br />The Polish smells wonderful. It is subtle but fresh and not overpowering - I am sensitive to smells and cannot stand strong perfumes. Sublime really nailed the scent.<br /><br />The texture is lightly grainy, in a good way. I have used face Polish in the past where the texture was too fine and I felt like I had to really scrub to get any exfoliation... It was not the case here. The texture was spot on. It wasn't harsh at all, and my skin is quite sensitive.<br /><br />The instructions are pretty standard.. Wet face, massage in circular motion, let sit for a couple of minutes, massage briefly and then wash off.<br /><br />The results, however, were surprising. It left my skin incredibly soft and silky, after just one use. After several uses, my skin felt like it had completely recovered from a summer in the sun.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredient list was also very reassuring.. The first ingredient listed is aloe.. No wonder it is so soothing.<br /><br />Overall, I am really happy with this product.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Opinions may differ but I've searched In earnest, tried It all, and I've found *THIS IS THE BEST*", "text": "I'm pretty particular, got a pretty good eye for discerninbg fine detail, worked in production for Universal Studios where where cosmetic detail is priority, , and for my aging beard, I've tried every product I can find.  It's been a little over 2 years since I tried the Grizzly product and have not looked for or tried anything since.  It's settled in my mind that you'll get the most realistic, undetectable, natural looking color enhancing of your beard.  I mix about 1/3 Dark Brown with 2/3 Black.  I do leave it on much longer than recommended sometimes 2-3 hours.<br /><br />I also do it before I go to sleep to avoid down time waiting.  IT DOES LOOK FUNNY WHEN YOU FIRST RINSE...\"but\"....it slowly changes to a natural look so you may want to DO IT AT NIGHT BEFORE BED or at least 6-8 hours before you venture out.  I've gotten both green and purple tint upon rinsing but again, *this is part of the process* and the exposure to air and time slowly oxidizes the pigment and it will look amazing in several hours.  Don't be afraid to mix shades to nail exactly what you want.  I've used it with 3-4 inches  beard length but lately keep it the \"unshaven\" stubble look with 1/8\" to 1/4\" length.  As far as cost goes, I buy two shades, I apply twice a week, and from those two bags I get a full year. My last purchase was Oct. '17 and I'm just coming back to re-order.  The previous year my beard was longer, maybe 3\", and I re-ordered twice in a 12 month period. ..so it's now costing me around $2.50 per month to keep my beard looking much younger and natural looking.<br /><br />My beard has much more gray than my hair, I'd say about 90% is white hairs.  It took  2 or 3 applications in the first week or two for it to fully \"take\" , then it's just maintenance.  I find the second and third days the best as it begins to fade just a little.... so the blend of just a bit of your natural gray with the treated looks impossible to detect any unnatural coloring.  I find day four fading a little more than I want so hit again on the fourth night.  I can start at 9pm, have the colors blended in a bowl, mixed with hot water (microwave), and applied on my beard by 9:05.  I'm retired now so sometimes I'll watch movies and leave it on until 4am... but I could rinse at go to bed by 10:30 and still wake up with the best, most natural looking color enhancement out  there.<br /><br />The BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />1.  If you just use the basic shades Grizzly should look better than anything you've tried before but don't be afraid to experiment by mixing colors if you want to nail your natural shade.  Even if you miss it will still look presentable and natural because many have hair/beard color differences.<br /><br />2.  Don't panic, freak out, or get discouraged when you first rinse.  The oxidation that will take place from exposure to air is part of the process that will give it the most natural appearance.  The browns will have a bit of a green tint, the black will be purple.  THIS CHANGES and transitions into a  natural shade over the course of a few hours so it's best to do it before you go to bed.  I've also found you can't leave it \"too long\".  I've actually fallen asleep for the night with the stuff on...it hardens as it dries but softens with water then rinses right off.  i find much better results when I leave on longer than instructed.  I try to go at least 90 minutes and much longer if time allows.  You forget it's on but don't leave the house.  I usually keep mine on until it dries and hardens before washing off.<br /><br />Henna is also a plant leaf so you'll smell like spinach until you rinse it off.  Pretty weird at first but I no longer even notice the smell.<br /><br />3.  If there are negative reviews or you try and don't get what you want, it's only because you didn't use the patience to allow it to work.  With a few tries I was able to come up with exactly what I wanted.  If you'll give it a chance, (it's a quick, simple, 5 minute process to mix and apply but does take an hour to \"take\" before you rinse, then few hours afterward to transition) use a little patience, THIS IS THE BEST product you'll find and you should be able to get exactly what you want, sharpen your appearance significantly ,with a completely natural, undetectable enhancement to your appearance.  5 STARS !!", "images": [], "asin": "B01BTG39WO", "parent_asin": "B01BTG39WO", "user_id": "AHTCJFP2BERXETEJPSNL66CNCAWQ", "timestamp": 1543440016504, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The product works amazing!!", "text": "First I want to say the three stars is for the product itself, which works great. Taking two stars off is for packaging, shipment, and customer service. So I ran out of nail polish remover not that long ago and have been looking for a better way to remove the nail polish with out all the chemicals. To my surprise I found this and was excited to try a all natural nail polish remover.  Made with all plant based ingredients which is a huge plus for me. I hate the way traditional nail polish remover smells and I hate using that stuff for my daughters nails. Now I feel comfortable using this with my daughter so she does not have to breath in those harsh fumes. I did not have any nail polish on at first so I put some on and let it dry. Once it was dry I put one to two drops on each nail then waited about 2 to 3 minutes. It wiped right off on all the nails except one small spot that came off with one more drop.<br /><br />When this bottle arrived it was leaking all over the box. The seal was broken and the plastic wrapped around the lid was torn. So I had very little left in the bottle. I contacted the seller to let them know and to see about getting a replacement bottle. I took some time to get a response but they did respond. After the second email they sent a code for a replacement. That code did not work so I reached out to them again. They said it is on amazon and that the code has worked for others. I tried multiple times and the code did not work. So even if it is on amazon to supply correct codes, the seller needs to do their part in making the experience pleseant with the customer and this was not that.<br /><br />Still pleased with the product itself though.<br /><br />I received this free or reduced price for product testing and review.

The Newborn size in Bambo is also big - we had to wait two months (11 pounds) to put them on our little boy. For all the new moms out there I would recommend getting small packs of few different brands of diapers to see which will work for their child. I tried 7th Generation and 365 too - those were way too thin and needed more height on the back for blowouts (they both allow for spectacular blowouts, I have to say!). Bambos have helped to control diaper rash and have very good absorbency. Honest diapers were good, but their newborn size had a mesh layer inside that kept sticking to the baby's skin and also allowed several moisture absorbing beads to stick to his skin when the diaper was very wet.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "What they say is true -- this stuff works!", "text": "I've been using this product for about 17 days now. To be honest, I haven't noticed too much of a difference. But then again, I don't really pay much attention to my eyelashes. I just decided to try this stuff for fun. So, today at lunch, my boyfriend of 10 years suddenly looked at me and said, \"Are you wearing false eyelashes? They really look long! I've never seen them that long before. They look great!\" Of course, I sat there with my mouth open, totally stunned. I thought that it must be a coincidence . . . maybe I put on more mascara than usual, or maybe he just happened to notice my eyelashes for the first time, etc. Then I thought that he's never said one thing about my eyelashes in the 10 years we've been together. Now that's either a really spooky coincidence or maybe, just maybe, this stuff actually works. I still think it's too early to tell and I continue to be skeptical at this point, but I thought I would at least put it out there for those who are considering this product. I'm not yet giving it my full endorsement because the verdict is still out, but I was just flabbergasted and stunned that I received such a comment after using this product for a little under 3 weeks. Is that crazy or what?!<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />This stuff definitely works. My eyelashes are so long that it's unbelievable. I was recently in a Vegas casino and the blackjack dealer at our table suddenly asked me, \"Are those your real eyelashes?\"  I am so pleased with the results. However, I don't recommend using this on your lower lashes (unless you really want them to be just as long as your upper lashes. I tried this and they were getting way too long to look natural). I think this is a great alternative to purchasing an expensive brand name product that requires a prescription. Two months later, I'm still on my first tube (applying it one time per day) and I believe this tube will probably last me another two months. I've never experienced any of the irritation or redness that others have, but I did notice that my eyes were a little itchy the following morning. I do recommend this product and I'm so excited to continue using it and seeing the results.  FYI -- a cheaper alternative that works just as well is Rapid Lash.  I've since switched to Rapid Lash because I can get about three tubes of that product for the price of one tube of Renew Lash.", "images": [], "asin": "B0039L9FKI", "parent_asin": "B0039L9FKI", "user_id": "AHJAM3HBKHINKJ3MIYUUH4GOVW3A", "timestamp": 1269394227000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

And that\u2019s saying something- since I have been a bleach blonde for about 13 years now, and have tried dozens and dozens of these, I\u2019ve never had one work so great, and be so powerful, and do what it\u2019s supposed to do, and yet be so gentle on my ends.. I\u2019ve used purple shampoos/toners that have absolutely ruined my dry bleached ends, seemingly \u201cchewed\u201d right through them, and left them looking and feeling so terrible, they aren\u2019t fixable, the only thing you can do is cut them off.. NOT THIS shampoo!! My ends are still healthy and smooth, and feel like they\u2019ve never been bleached! I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better purple shampoo!! The only reason for the 4 stars on the scent is because - it isn\u2019t MY favorite, BUT it\u2019s better than most, and to be fair, it\u2019s really not bad, just not great!

None of the tubes have color names on them, just numbers. Also included is a 7x4in drawstring bag. It's made from very soft, velvety material and it is light pink with the company name &quot;Chialstar&quot; in a darker pink.<br />The lip gloss goes on easily and smoothly and lasts for quite awhile; I usually only have to reapply once or twice at most. The only thing I dislike about these glosses is the slightly glue like texture while the color is drying and still tacky.

The rest of the details on the packaging is not in English unfortunately.  Opening the individually wrapped foil type envelope you pull out a pair of white crescent shaped under eye pads.  They are shaped for placement under each eye with each being unique to your left and right eye.  They adhere in place well, and yet the peel off easy with no discomfort.  They are soft to the touch and cool and soothing on your skin.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />My wife was looking for a new eye patch for aging eyes.  These patches diminish the dark circles in the eye area.  Helps shrink puffy bags and any swelling in general.  Noticed a brightening of the skin tone under the eye (lighter and brighter).  Recommend these eye pads.  I will order these again.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Not moisturizing.", "text": "[[VIDEOID:4eaf048eb55433860172118977ad0ff1]] I\u2019ve used the entire box, exactly as directed and cannot recommend this product.<br /><br />The only things I liked about this product is that it\u2019s unscented and the packaging is kind of fun, but that is absolutely outweighed by the possibility cutting yourself.<br /><br />It does not do what it says. It doesn\u2019t provide \u201cintensive plumping\u201d or\u201dimprove skin elasticity\u201d which are just ridiculous claims, particularly when you consider this used for one week and the first two ingredients are water and glycerine. I have pure glycerine and  after mixing it with water in various percentages, I\u2019d be comfortable betting that this product is at least 70% water.<br /><br />I was able to cleanly snap all seven ampoules using the plastic topper provided. Even though my snaps were clean the edges of both pieces are sharp and you shouldn\u2019t touch them. It took me several tries to figure out how to get all the serum out of the ampoules. For three days I was tapping the opening on my palm which didn\u2019t feel great, but I just couldn\u2019t get it to pour out cleanly.<br /><br />Although it is almost as liquid as water, if you get the opening of the ampoules covered with the liquid it won\u2019t come out because of surface tension. If this happens just turn the bottle open side up and blow on the liquid until the opening is clear and you\u2019re good to go.<br /><br />If you can tilt the bottle just right you can get the serum to pour out. It\u2019s tricky, but spend the time doing it that way and you\u2019ll save yourself a lot of frustration. You see me getting it right in the video, but even then I had to blow the ampoule open once.<br /><br />There is also the cost. $50.00 for one week of use. That\u2019s about $200 a month and $1250 a year although it does specify that you should use this daily for six weeks, maximum. Why? Is that concerning to anyone else? Anyway, even if you have money to burn you would do well spending it on a procedure from a dermatologist or a flight to Dubai for vacation.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Unique Hair Toy", "text": "I've never seen anything quite like this invisibobble hair toy before. It's a completey new approach for curly-cord scrunchies since you put them on the same way you would put a twist-tie on. Wrap it around your hair and twist the two beads together to lock it into place. Then untwist the beads later to remove it.<br /><br />The beads are nice and smooth and the curly cord is tightly wound and firmly attached to each bead, yet quite flexible. My beads are pink, which I adore, but I can already tell that I'd love to have them in lots of colors or designs.<br /><br />The whole thing is smaller than I thought it would be. For some reason, I thought it would be about the size of those figure-8 ponytail holders with a bead at each end that we used to wear when we were little. It's much smaller than those. It's 2.5 inches (6.35 centimeters) from end to end if I just lay it on a table. I managed to comfortably stretch it out to 7 inches (17.78 centimeters) and it could surely stretch more, but I didn't want to force it.<br /><br />2.5 inches isn't very much when it comes to wrapping it around the base of a pony tail or braid, though, so you'll most likely need to stretch it to put it on. That's a bit tricky to get the hang of, but you can mess around with it on someone else's hair or the ends of your hair if it's long or on a few strands from your mop or a twisted-up handkerchief or anything soft you can wrap it around. Once you get a feel for how to work it, you can use it in your hair.<br /><br />It's designed to only need to wrap around your hair once, so it doesn't need to be very long. That said, I'd love a much longer one that I can wrap around my ponytail several times. That would make it so I could wrap it around the base of my bun as well, which would be a very cute look. I suppose you could get creative and twist several of these together to form a longer one with lots of beads along it. That would be extra cute, because you'd end up with several beads around your pony tail or bun.<br /><br />In looking at it, I worried that it would eventually stretch out and no longer work, but apparently the company already thought of that and it's not an issue. If the cord stretches out, you can coil it tightly again simply by dropping the invisibobble into hot water for a few seconds or blowing on it with a blow dryer or setting it in the sun or dangling it above a heater. That's great news and encourages me to experiment with this thing and see how many ways I can figure out to use it.<br /><br />Some folks have mentioned that these get tangled up in their hair while others have said they never tangle in their hair. I'm one of the people whose hair the invisibobble likes to get tangled up in. I suspect it has to do with whether your hair is straight or not. My hair has a bit of a wave to it, so it likes to grab onto (or be grabbed onto by) whatever it encounters. That said, if it gets tangled around your hair or if your hair gets tangled up around it, you can wiggle the cord to separate the coils and your hair will slide freely between them. Everything on the invisibobble is smooth, so you'll always be able to unwind or pull your hair out of it without pulling any of your hair out of your head or breaking any of it.<br /><br />For those of you who get one and decide that it's not a hair toy you're comfortable using, it would make a great and very cute bag-tie or you could use it as a cord-keeper for cell-phone cords, etc. It has the added advantage in that you can put it on and take itthem off with one hand, freeing up your other hand to hold the coiled-up cord that you're managing. Not only that, but if you use it as a cord-keeper and want to use the cord, you can untwist the invisibobble, unwind the cord, and twist the invisibobble right back onto the cord, which will hang onto it for you until you need to put it away again. Then, all it will take is a quick untwist, coil, and twist to put the cord away.", "images": [], "asin": "B099SBMJWC", "parent_asin": "B09VH7M73X", "user_id": "AFJ2UX5PRHZSFRVDPALAVATWX7EQ", "timestamp": 1646686558864, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

The black soap shampoo was just ok... again, I have the same products, so I could probably have made this myself.  Plus, the smell was a little off-putting.  The mango butter was really disappointing.  I know this is beyond the seller's control, but it arrived melted.  I thought maybe it would solidify after I stuck it in the refrigerator, but it didn't.  I added some raw cacao butter to thicken the texture, and it helped some, but the texture was still goopy and grainy.  I hate waste, so I use this as a body butter and after I shampoo because it does help to retain the moisture in my hair.  All-in-all, the products were okay.

In chrono order:<br /><br />(1) First I had read the many poor reviews of easyfeet.<br />(2) Then I phoned Easyfeet, whereupon the guy insisted that the suction is excellent and the reviews were not true.<br />(3) So I found a place to buy this cheap, since I wanted them for a senior citizen<br />(4) Upon receipt I confirmed that the poor reviews proved correct. The suction cups are the kind which are LIMP & SHALLOW instead of \"firm/resilient rubber\".<br /><br />Having bought & tried many bath mats over the years, I have experience with both good & bad suction cups. You'd be surprised how many bath mats have flat/limp suction cups. I had bought once a PVC bath mat from a reputable company which had similar limp cups. Upon complaining to them, they immediately replaced it with an identical mat, BUT this time, the model number was different. Because they knew full well that the latter model had deeper/firmer/resilient suction-cups which actually work, instead of shifting around!<br /><br />(5) Finally, as stated previously, the bristles of easyfeet are a bad joke. (the upper ones) More like the bristles of a baby brush than the type to give a massage, the way the lower ones are. But actually, all of them are sorta scratchy. Instead, they should have used SWEEPA type of bristles.

Knowing I shouldn't put this in the dishwasher i hand washed it like I normally would any plastic food item, soak it in water, scrub, rinse and dry.  Well went back to use it again and the heat from the water caused it to warp.  Not too bad but my son (3 years old) now needs help since it takes some tricky maneuvering to make it look like the gorilla.<br /><br />So beware, works and looks good just be careful when washing.", "images": [], "asin": "B014S2D8UO", "parent_asin": "B014S2D8UO", "user_id": "AF4UHXZZURFRNO3KR3BILRW2T7OQ", "timestamp": 1525225274747, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

I appreciated that there were different thicknesses depending on how strong a hold you needed.<br /><br /> I have thin hair and I found the thinnest bands seemed to hold best without pulling on my hair.  I used them at the gym and found that they held up well through my workout.  Like any band they stretch a little over time which I actually prefer because they adjust to fit your hair the best.  Eventually as like with all ponytail holders I have used these seem like they may stretch out too much over time but they were durable and I didn't have an issue in the few weeks I have used so far so I don't think there is a longevity issue.<br /><br />The one thing I did not like about these holders is that they have a plastic piece at the connection of the band.  To me this was the only but important con and the reason I probably wouldn't switch brands.  However, this is not unique to this brand and if that doesn't bother you these are a great option.  They come in a variety of colors and were of good quality.  If anything this piece will probably help them last longer but for me I have worries about hair snagging.  Although I will still continue to use the ones I have it is not my first choice.  I think if you are careful while using them there wouldn't be an issue.<br /><br />**I have received the product for free or at a discounted price for purposes of giving my honest review.

Ideal as a Massage Oil & Aromatherapy. Carrier Oil Made in USA from Sky Organics<br /><br />Pros:<br />I love the pump that it comes with - it works great and gives you a consistent amount per pump.<br />Nice on the skin - doesn't make it overly oily (it makes it seem kinda like when your forehead has oil on it)<br /><br />Cons:<br />isn't organic, at least they don't say it is.  It feels like they have organics in the name hoping you'll think it's organic<br /><br />Note:<br />The pump on mine pumps almost exactly 4ml - you'll want to measure your own, but I like that it's consistent<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />First off, fractionated coconut oil is a byproduct of making lauric acid.  But once again we have found a good way of putting the byproduct to use.  This oil is great on the skin and hair, and has several other properties that make it good for you in general.<br /><br />Video:<br />I show the unboxing in the video.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "This skin cream is remarkable", "text": "I had previously been using prescription-strength 2.5% cortisone cream on a recurring rash on my forehead, continuously for over 2 years to keep it under control. This rash just appeared one day in early December 2014, near my hairline, kept spreading and within a few weeks it had taken over my entire forehead. The rash started to break out on my chin, and my forehead was so swollen that even my eyelids swelled nearly shut. I was in misery, and was using ice packs on my face just to keep the inflammation down a little so I could sleep. Finally I obtained a tube of the strongest cortisone cream available, and that slowly resolved the rash. However, even after it cleared up, it would start to re-appear and I had to keep dabbing small amounts of cortisone cream on it, usually on my hairline, sometimes on my forehead or behind my earlobes.<br />My skin would break out, get flaky, and itch if I didn't use the cortisone cream. After more than two years of this, I stopped the cortisone for a few days, and again my forehead broke out and became flaky. I had read about Synertek because I was researching colostrum for its gut-healing ability. I requested this Synertek Colostrum Regenerating Skin Cream for a Christmas gift 2016, and received it Christmas Eve. I scrubbed off the flakiness, which left reddish open (but not deep) sores on my forehead, and immediately I started using the colostrum skin cream. In only one day I noticed improvement and healing taking place. Within 2 days, my rash cleared up. I was amazed.<br />On occasion, the rash does re-appear if I have eaten something that I react to. But as long as I keep using this colostrum cream, it clears up quickly, and I become aware of yet another food that I am apparently allergic to.<br />After using cortisone for so long, this colostrum cream is near-miraculous to me. Thank you, Synertek. Because of this, I now also use the colostrum powder, the skin serum, and the eye cream. And I just ordered the liquid for my son's nosebleeds and for abrasions.", "images": [], "asin": "B00VSB0XS4", "parent_asin": "B00VSB0XS4", "user_id": "AHIYE6TMSGF7RLE57RZSK2SWZIJA", "timestamp": 1492717330000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Sweet, lovely, smells just like the name", "text": "I am not an impulse buyer. So before I spend $$$ on a parfum, I did some extensive research. First, I knew I wanted to have a Tom Ford because of his reputation in making parfum. Then I narrowed down the choices to the 5 most preferred private blends by online reviewers. Then I bought .5ml sample for each. After trying them one by one, my husband made the choice for me: Noir de Noir, but my favorite is Amber Absolute.<br /><br />Vanilla Tobacco is really sweet and nice, with straight forward vanilla tabacco notes. Vanilla is sweet and yummy. The tabacco smells like Turkish tobacco: sweet and sexy. I can imagine that whoever wears this could be quite irresistible. This is one of my favorite. However, compared to Noir de Noir, I feel that it lacks a bit complexity. It is a bit straight forward Vanilla and tobacco.<br /><br />From my research and trial, I find that parfum is very personal, and you have to try it in person. It is better to try it at home and wear it once or twice before you buy it at a store. The 5 scents I tried:<br /><br />- Noir de Noir: complex, sweet, lovely scent. Not overwhelmingly floral, not overpowering, and not sharp/edgy. This is my husband's favorite when I wear it.<br /><br />- Vanilla Tobacco<br /><br />- Amber Absolute: Unique, herbal. Stronger than Noir de Noir. Initially, I couldn't stand Amber Absolute. It smelled to me like Chinese medicine box. But then I am totally in love with it. It is very unusual. It has a very unique dried herb fragrance and very complex. It reminds me of the fragrance in the air in Big Sur, CA or Mono Lake, CA when the flowers and plants are drying in fall. The fragrance is not floral, not particularly sexy or feminine.<br /><br />- Tuscan leather: couldn't stand it, very leathery.<br /><br />- Neroli Portofino: didn't like it at all.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Milk Perfume", "text": "Just received Milk perfume by K.Hall Designs and I love it! I ordered the candle from this line earlier so that I could have an idea what the perfume smells like and I have to say that the two is very close in scent, except in the perfume I can detect a hint of coconut that I wasn't able to in the candle (even though it's suppose to be there, but maybe that's just me). Milk is not overly sweet at all, it is a perfect balance between creaminess and sweetness, a mellow concoction that is very comforting, a darling little scent that delivers creaminess with a hint of vanilla and coconut. Because it is not a serious scent, it might appeal to a younger audience or to those that normally don't wear perfume. I think it is excellent in the winter time when one uses moisturizers such as almond, honey, vanilla, cocoa etc. as it does combine really well with these scents. In fact, I bought Milk to go with L'Occitane's Almond line and I must say it layers very nicely with it. Like I said, this is such a simple scent, but by no means it is cheap, gaudy or car-freshener like, it reminds me a little of those baby-colognes that you can buy..but a little more grown up.<br /><br />Update 1/30/2012:<br />..so, I've been using this perfume for a few weeks now and I noticed that it turns a little too coconutty. When I compare the scent of the candle and the perfume, I can definitively detect more coconut in the perfume, like I said before, and it just has a toasted coconut with a hint of vanilla scent. I much prefer the milky-vanilla scent of the candle, without the overload of the coconut. I think a more appropriate name for this perfume would be \"Coconut\".<br />As far as lasting power goes..it's not bad for a perfume.", "images": [], "asin": "B004FJV9FC", "parent_asin": "B004FJV9FC", "user_id": "AHCOOIS74ORQ3FZ6RGJ4BX657GKA", "timestamp": 1326398600000, "helpful_vote": 14, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Classy, durable and elegant! Great as a gift!", "text": "[[VIDEOID:8b9fe3ccc3d2cdcd02b52d60c9c869fb]] I just bought this double edge handled safety razor set of ACEVIVI and I\u2019m so glad that I did! I really like it as it features durability and of high quality. It is chrome plated, has nice grip and it does not slip while working on my facial hair according to my husband. I like that it has long handles, thick and safe. It is ideal for people with large hands! It is very sharp and works well on removing the facial hair of my husband.<br /><br />What I like most about this razor is that it is of high quality. The construction is really great with very impressive details! Also, it has some weight on it. Thanks to the aluminum used, solid and very durable!<br /><br />I gave it to him as a birthday gift and he was so pleased with it! It was his first time to own such classy and elegant looking razor with 5 blades! It came with a nice box so I just wrap it with a birthday wrapper. I highly recommend it!<br /><br />I was blessed to receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest/unbiased review during its promotional period.

I also tested a little bit out on my face as a moisturizer and noticed that a small pimple formed the next day.  After giving the regimen a rest, I have slowly begun to try to apply it again and it doesn't seem as though any new chalazions are forming, so maybe it was purely coincidental.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Awesome Blossom! REVIEW UPDATED - Broke after 2 months.", "text": "This little gadget is awesome.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it took me some time to get acquainted with the settings and how they function.  I did read the manual which was helpful but in the end it was trial and error that got me through it.  Basically, if anything on screen is blinking that particular feature is in set up mode. You click the opposite button to then opt out and go on to the next feature.  The features are R, L, Temperature and Time.  Don't worry this review will clarify a few of your questions.  Once you get past how to operate the settings, it works great!  It is automatically is set to start on Celsius. The hottest temperature is 200 degrees Celsius which is the same as 390 degrees Fahrenheit.  Since I use it on the hottest temperature I leave it on 200 degrees Celsius so I don't have to change it to Fahrenheit all of the time.  If you want to change it to Fahrenheit you can do this by clicking both buttons together 4 times.  What I didn't know until after I used it is that you can change the direction in how the curling iron rolls, either clockwise or counter clockwise.  This is represented with an L for Left and a R for Right.  So next time I am going to reverse from L to R when I curl the other side of my hair.  Pretty neat.  Another thing to note is that you have to choose how many seconds you want to curl your hair.  I choose 8 seconds.  The roller will spin your hair for about 6 seconds and then stop. Do not pull your hair out yet.  It will begin to start beeping until the amount of time you selected is over.  The beeping will stop and this is when you can easily release the button and pull your hair out. If you abide by this feature you will ensure that you get even curls all around your head.  It works best when you use small bundles of hair at a time.  I tried to be lazy and my hair got caught up in it.  If this happens don't panic.  This device is actually really user friendly.  Just release the button and slowly push it and release, push and release until it unrolls your hair. Do not just yank your hair out.  I curled my hair at work during my break time.  I charged it at my desk with PC.  It was so simple that I did not require a mirror.  It was so convenient.  I loved not having cords to mess with.  It takes about 4hrs to fully charge.  Once fully charged it will last  about an hour.  It only took me 10-15 minutes to curl my hair but I noticed that I can only use twice without charging it or it will run out of power.  For this reason I make sure to charge it after each use so that it's ready for when I need it.  Make sure to unplugged it after it's fully charge so that you don't ruin the lithium battery.  If you do forget to charge it and run out of power it will operate if it's plugged in with a USB cord.  It is portable, lightweight and the outer casing does not get hot to the touch.  Not once did I fear I was going to burn my neck or hand. Love this!  Oh also, it will automatically shut off after 10 minutes if you forget to turn it off.  I highly recommend for adults, teenagers and even younger girls.  I just wish the settings will hold in place so that you don't have to go through this step each time before use.  Regardless, I am still on board! A+++  Enjoy!<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE:  I am submitting an updated review because the curling iron stopped working after a couple of months.  I do not curl my hair every day and it still broke on me.  During mid-use the digital screen started going out on me and it began making one long continuous ringing noise.  I could not power it off no matter how hard I tried!  I had to put it in another room and let it ring for a couple of hours until the battery died.  I have not tried powering it on again in fear that the same thing will happen again.  It's as good as broken to me and I will not be using it anymore.  It was great while lasted.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41swoSXFXKL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41swoSXFXKL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41swoSXFXKL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51GFfR3zg0L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51GFfR3zg0L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51GFfR3zg0L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51aXiQTVP8L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51aXiQTVP8L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51aXiQTVP8L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51osWfmizSL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51osWfmizSL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51osWfmizSL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yv9jXijtL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yv9jXijtL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yv9jXijtL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B09G22586Y", "parent_asin": "B09G22586Y", "user_id": "AGT25T75GPP77UQXZPWUYGKEXH4A", "timestamp": 1644536683531, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

As mentioned above though, my favorite part is that I can use it without worrying about artifical junk harming my body. A lot of products do contain so many harmful ingrdiants. So I really love that this does not. It leaves my face clean without the negative side effects. Its amazing!!<br /><br />\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97 I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. It works and you don't have to worry about sulfates and other harmful ingredients.<br /><br />\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97 I received this product at a discount. This plays no part in my ratings though. I rate solely on my experiences. My experiences are honest and unbiased. Had I paid full retail price, I would still have rated 5 stars because I truly love this product.

Hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan, a very long chain of disaccharides (sugars) present in all connective tissues that is responsible for retaining moisture. As we age, levels of hyaluronic acid fall\u2014some say by as much as 50 percent. Genetics, smoking, and magnesium and zinc deficiencies appear to accelerate this loss, but it happens to all of us to some degree.<br /><br />One of the benefits of hyaluronic acid is its effectiveness at maintaining healthy, youthful skin. The reason is because hyaluronic acid is an essential component of the skin. Thanks to its ability to promote collagen production and retain hundreds of times its weight in water, hyaluronic acid keeps the skin plumped up and hydrated.<br /><br />The combined benefits of these ingredients make for an amazing anti-aging and nourishing moisturizer for your skin.", "images": [], "asin": "B01M1EMJHZ", "parent_asin": "B01M1EMJHZ", "user_id": "AGS3DSKEFPAU33QRONTVBYCLYYOQ", "timestamp": 1475436330000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent magnetic lashes!", "text": "I love these. I like that they are mink. And I especially like how they have the little case with a mirror. That\u2019s impossible to find. They work great and stay on my whole 12 hour shift. They are waterproof and you can\u2019t scrub off with just water, not that a person would try. Cold cream works ok. But if you get some lash cleaner or makeup remover and apply to the end of a cotton swab and gently rub along lash, they practically fall off in seconds. At first, I was peeling them off because I thought since it\u2019s magnetic that\u2019s all that\u2019s sticking. But then it\u2019s hard to get the eyeliner off. After using a remover it\u2019s much better. Don\u2019t worry if you have trouble using liquid eyeliner. I promise after practicing a time or two, it will work perfect. If you get out of line, very quickly wipe off excess. It dries quickly. If it takes longer to put them on after applying liner, it will probably still work good. If you put lashes on sooner than you are supposed to and it\u2019s not dried as well as it should be, it still works. It\u2019s just a little messier for the lashes after removing them. I\u2019ve learned to also use my lash remover or makeup remover to clean my lashes afterwards. They will have some liner dried to them and this builds up. I put them in my palm and squirt some on and gently rub with my finger or a swab. I don\u2019t take much effort but get some of it off pretty good. They last me a good 5 or more times depending on how bad I bend them putting on lol. That\u2019s another thing, you don\u2019t have to have a real steady hand to apply them. I use my fingers instead of the holder thing. I normally start in the center but sometimes on the inside. You can adjust them if they are too long on one side. You can also trim them. Please don\u2019t do this while they are on lol. I tried this and cut too much off. I was lazy lol. Most the time I have mine bent good to put on. Well, I should say curved instead of bent lol. They aren\u2019t as fragile as they would seem. I love them. Only thing that worries me, if you ever are in an accident with them on and they take you for an MRI , I worry my eyelids will pull off because of the magnetic particles lol.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Works but .....", "text": "*** Below is my original review (edited now)  and i will add some points now that I have used it off and on. I did find another product and It's ok, not as good. Given it was half the price it may come down to a budget thing. Okay, having said that, I found a weakness to the Velour adhesive. I use eye drops at home and work. Computers. Dry eye. If I apply drops more that a couple of times a day the lashes come loose on the inside end. So I have taken to adding some glue to the lashes in addition to the Velour and moving my placement a bit. If it weren't for the drops I thin the adhesive last pretty well.  You can see where this will lead though.<br />If the product stays so expensive and Prime continues to be unavailable, my use of it may not last. Good product, too expensive for the amount you get and extra security needed if you use eye drops.<br />Perhaps the company could lower the price to compensate for no Prime. A meet in the middle :)<br /><br />Original Review: (edited a bit)<br />This makes putting lashes on go a lot faster. Period. Having said that I will now throw in what I have noticed and wish for.<br />Less expensive.<br />I don't know way some things are included w/Prime & others not, but please include this with Prime.<br /><br />I want to order this again but because it is such a small amount for the cost I will be trying other products. I may come back to this one of course, but I would not go off exploring if the cost was less since I know it works well. . I understand you have to stay in business. If this is the price point that keeps the product available, so be it.<br /><br />Tips. If you have any length or curl to your own lashes, it is tricky to not touch them while applying. I don't usually wear liner so that could just be me.<br />This makes lashes a bit easier to apply and having had mine destroyed by extension (4 months)s, despite the quality of the gal doing the service, I may continue to use this alternative, it works.", "images": [], "asin": "B084J7LHZ2", "parent_asin": "B084J7LHZ2", "user_id": "AHO4YPJHEE2B6ZFUJZSS7PMADYBQ", "timestamp": 1596288348251, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

With the same amount of dye from a different brand I can almost dye my hair twice. Probably because this is rather thick<br /><br />- the fact that it contains silicone. I did not see that until too late. So I\u2019ve been washing with a clarifying shampoo in between to make sure I get them out of my hair. Of course this will affect how long it stays vibrant.<br /><br />I have gotten so many compliments with this color but the silicone thing is just a no no for me, so I\u2019ll probably not buy it again.

Having used it now for a couple months (they recommend that you use it a few months to get accustomed to it) I consider my evaluation as being legitimate.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Love The Fat", "text": "Mitchell\u2019s Wool Fat has a reputation of being finicky about the right amount of water. It took me a while to figure it out, but with some tips from the Mitchell\u2019s company, I have come up with this process.<br /><br />1. When you receive your puck and are ready to put it to use, place it in a container slightly larger than the puck and cover it with water. The Mitchell\u2019s Crock is the perfect size for this.<br /><br />2. Check the puck every day and top off the water if necessary. When the puck expands to fill the container from side to side, drain the water and leave only enough on the surface to keep it from drying out.<br /><br />3. Soak your brush in warm, not hot water while you take a shower.<br /><br />4. Remove the brush from the water and squeeze our the excess. You want the brush wet, but not dripping water.<br /><br />5. Drain the bloom water off the puck into your lather bowl. If you face lather, use it to wet down your face.<br /><br />6. Swirl the brush over the top of the soap for about 30 seconds. Add another 30 seconds if you have hard water.<br /><br />7. If you bowl lather, swirl the brush in the bowl until the bloom water is incorporated into the soap. Add a few drops of water and continue to swirl. Repeat this process until you have the later you desire. Even with too much water, The Fat will provide a slick layer on your face. With the right amount of water, you will get thick rich lather. If you start to get large bubbles in your lather that don\u2019t disappear, then you\u2019ve got too much water. You can fix this by loading more soap from the puck.<br /><br />7B If you face lather, go from the puck to your face and build the lather by brushing in circular motions on your face. Dip the tips of the brush in warm water to add more water until you have the lather you desire.<br /><br />8. Shave and enjoy the slickness that only The Fat can provide.<br /><br />9. Rinse between passes with cold water and again after your final pass.<br /><br />10. When you are done, apply your alum block to your freshly shaved face, then after about a minute, milk the remaining soap from your brush and use it to clean the alum from your face. Rinse in cold water and perform the rest of your shave routine.<br /><br />If you decide to purchase a puck of The Fat and put in the time to learn how to lather it, you won\u2019t want to use any other soap. The only thing missing from the fat is a perfume scent. The Fat smells like clean fresh linen. That\u2019s why I only gave it three stars for the scent. I love the smell, but most of you are looking for some artificial flower smell...you won\u2019t find that in The Fat.", "images": [], "asin": "B06XRZ6Q4Z", "parent_asin": "B06XRZ6Q4Z", "user_id": "AG6574FKR4YZL54DXVGEOI4AKUSQ", "timestamp": 1605305532395, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A shaving-system in a box", "text": "This ZAKORA electric shaver is actually an IPX7 water-resistant shaving system that includes brush and trimming accessories to use with the shaver. It also includes a standard razor handle with 3 cartridges. This ZAKORA electric shaver is rechargeable and uses UBC C charging so there's no need to think about taking along a separate micro USB cable if you're taking this ZAKORA electric shaver along with you on a trip.<br /><br />I used this device for a bit over a month and it held up well. I shave 2-3 times each week using it on both my head and my beard. Being able to use this shave wet or dry is a huge convenience. So is being able to pop off the rotary shaving head to replace it with either of the included trimmers.  The items combined with the standard razor make this ZAKORA electric shaver a complete shaving system that helps keep a person well-groomed both at home and while on-the-go.<br /><br />What I liked most about this ZAKORA electric shaver was:<br />- Delivered a close, comfortable shave.<br />- Had enough attachments to keep me from having to use multiple shaving tools to shave my head, manage my beard, and trim any loose hairs between my brows, ears, or nose.<br />- USB C charging is extremely convenient, especially if you use this ZAKORA electric shaver away from the home.<br /><br />What I liked least about this ZAKORA electric shaver was:<br />- 1:1 charging. 90 mins of charging only yields 90 minutes of shaving. A bigger internal battery would have resolved this issue.<br />- I am not sure how to acquire replacement cartridges for the standard razer that's included in the package.<br /><br />Overall, if your looking for a complete shaving solution at a great price this Zakora electric shaver should make your shortlist. This Zakora electric shaver comes with everything a person needs to shave their head, manage their beard, and eliminate most loose hairs around the brows, ears, and nose. This shaving kit even has a standard razor handle and 3 cartridges for those occasions when a manual razor is required. I wish this Zakora electric shaver had a bigger battery and there was a way to get more blades for the included standard shaver.

While not purchased from Amazon, these are the same blades I received from Philips.}<br />I used the SH50 replacement blades for a  4100 series Philips razor.  I use my razor not just for my face, but also to maintain my shiny bald head!  Therefore, the razor and blades get quite a work out.  I wanted to replace the blades some time ago, but the negative reviews concerned me enough that I delayed.  Finally, I had to move forward.<br />I wanted to make sure that I was not going to get blades made by a 3rd party, so I contacted Philips directly to ensure I was getting their blades.  The box I received looks exactly like what you see  here on Amazon.  They also gave me a discount code when I contacted them, which is why I purchased from them.<br />Upon arrival, I over-analyzed the replacement process because of comments I had read here.  At least for the 4100, the replacement was an absolute breeze, and I would have been better off not worrying.  You do need to align each of the blades a little, but if you pay attention when you pop out the previous blades, it's simple.  The next time I do this, it will take me less than 60 seconds.<br />In case I didn't like the new blades, I set the old ones aside.  Then I waited--3 days--so there was a solid amount of growth to give these new blades a right proper test!  As I write this, that test was just completed.  The blades passed with flying colors.  It's like the razor was brand new again.  There was no pulling at all.  The shave was smooth, and so is my head.

Maybe that will work better.<br /><br />I love this brush cleaner. First off, it's high quality. It doesn't feel cheap at all. As a matter of fact, it's better than I expected it to be. There are 3 speeds, the third is supposed to be 13,000 rotations per minute, its what it says in the manual. Idk if that's true, but it does go faster than expected. Also, I cleaned about 100 brushes before it started to slow down (the battery was dying). It doesn't hold every single brush, I think I had to hand wash 1 or 2 of my 150. So it holds most of them with no problem.<br />  I saw people using a second bowl to rinse their brushes, so I tried that, but I realized and could see that the rinse bowl didn't have any soap or makeup in it. There may have been a TINY amount of soap in it, but not enough to justify a clean and rinse of every brush. I guess if I didn't have like 150 to clean, I could do both, but some how when you pull the brush out of the water/soap, and it's spinning, the water and soap spin out, so the brush is actually clean and doesn't need a rinse.<br />  Also, I like that the device is rechargeable. I've heard so many stories, on YouTube in the comments, of people getting a device like this and it being run on batteries. They say you have to change them a lot. And you never know when they'll run out, so you have to keep extra batteries on hand. This charges up relatively quick, but it wasn't completely dead any time I recharged it, I just plugged it in when it started going a little bit slower than normal.<br />  Anyway, I love this and will keep my brushes cleaner than they've ever been because I can go from a dirty brush, open the cupboard, soap, water, device, clean and dry in under 2 mins. If everything is set up, I can go from dirty to clean and dry brush in about 30 to 45 seconds, depending on the thickness of the brush. An eye brush can be dirty and cleaned, ready to use in UNDER 30 seconds. It's amazing. Buy it! You won't regret it. I promise!", "images": [], "asin": "B07D37R8YZ", "parent_asin": "B07D37R8YZ", "user_id": "AGJ7NFI7MYSAUGS3EMRQOCYQ6CXA", "timestamp": 1565638342306, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

The battery charge lasts for a while, usually 3 to 4 buzzing sessions for me. The entire set is also small enough to pack in my suitcase when I travel. BUT...less than a month after I purchased, one of the guides broke. The little tabs that hold it in place while mounted on the unit are gone. They must have broken when I packed them all in a little bag in my suitcase. The manufacturer could improve this by using higher quality, more pliable plastic. Another thing I don't like is that the unit will not operate while it is plugged in, so if you lose charge in the middle of a buzzing session you will have to wait. And the batteries completely recharges in several hours. Since the batteries are nickel cadmium it's a good idea to discharge it completey, and recharge it completely every time or else the battery life will be shortened.

Please believe I have tried sponge rollers, hot rollers, the head band curls, regular curling irons, curling wands, and straighteners (to curl) and absolutely nothing has ever worked- except for the bed head rock n roller! It takes a little practice, I found it works best if you hold the iron vertically (pointing down) and wrap the hair from the top down. It makes pretty tight girls that I like to then sleep on, or brush out a little to get that perfect wavy look.

THIS MAKES IT MUCH EASIER!!!  The lower pieces can be easy to lose if your work area (bathroom counter) is cluttered, but can usually be found clinging to something that has metal.

Do not melt or microwave as that will destroy the benefits of milling and leave you with something that will not lather.

Sure it's a little messy and is best used at night to avoid any weird comments if the charcoal doesn't completely wash out. It's lightweight, so yes, it can very easily make a mess, but if you read the instructions and use a little common sense, you'll get over it pretty quick. The first use was a learning curve. We both decided to use it. I usually wet my brush and you can use this product on its own, or top off the toothpaste on your brush with this charcoal. If used by itself it does stain much more - your lips and teeth. It's best used before bed like this so you can brush out any residue in the morning. I recommend having a small nail brush handy. With this you can quickly rinse off the charcoal that sticks on your sink - it definitely won't stain the sink permanently.<br />This is great for surface stains and I've seen a slight color of change with my teeth - but nothing significant enough to say this is a great, strong whitener.

They love these brushes and I have to attest using these to comb thru their hair makes things a world easier and less of a hassle I do wish they had a grip on the handle for wet hands but really outside of that I dont have any complaints. These come in packs of 2 and even if you dont have kids using one in a purse and keeping one home is enough reasons to get these especially if you have thick hair these are amazing. My kids are mixed and range from hair length to neck length to butt length and I will tell you these are amazing at handling getting thru those thick tangles. The back has a piece that allows you to have the comb itself at different firmness I like the top one personally it is the firmest level.

It would be awesome for traveling or everyday storage. I purchased the white set.  They look so expensive! The handle is solid and they are very well made.  Initially the clutch has a slight smell.  It faded away.  The brushes did not have a smell.<br /><br />I washed the brushes as I would any other brush before using them.  No brush hair fell out during washing.  They are super soft.  I can not explain. They almost seem like velvet.  They feel so &#34;high end!&#34;<br /><br />I absolutely love the variety of big brushes. I love them all.  My favorite is the flat top brush. It is amazing at applying foundation. It was flawless.  I used them for applying powder, bronzer, blush and I was so impressed.<br /><br />I definitely like the smaller brushes also.

I use nail wraps for more than just nails.<br /><br />My son has a medical device (dex cgm) that includes a sensor attached to his body that is a little bigger than the larger nail wraps.  It gets boring and it's nice to change up how it looks a bit.  The larger nail wraps do a great job of changing it up and adding a little fun at times to the dull medical device.<br /><br />These nail wraps are a little smaller then others we've had so they don't  cover the entire sensor quite as thoroughly as others we've used, but it's decent.<br /><br />Nail wraps work much better than stickers or things like that.  Nail wraps look more like they are painted on, like they belong there vs stickers.  Plus this devices gets a lot of wear and sticks don't last and look awful quickly.  We also typically cover the sensor with a clear tape and it sticks to  stickers and so even covered they come off as soon as the tape is removed.  Nail wraps, are more oa nail polish and last a long time - they can last a few months if you don't decided the change it sooner.<br /><br />While the Tattify wraps are a little small, I LOVE that they offer a lot of boy and make teen appropriate designs.  The hard part of changing the look of medical devices has always been finding designs that a boy and especially a mail teen likes.<br /><br />The second use - we have a teen daughter.  Our son gets the bigger ones for his sensor, our daughter gets the small ones for her nails.  It's a great double use and win win all around.<br /><br />I LOVE the monopoly symbols.

My daughter does her up-do's with her hands though and only inserts the stick to hold her completed look so these sticks have been perfect for her. These are really pretty and make a lovely gift for anyone with long hair. I purchased the set of 3 wood sticks but the seller kindly enclosed a sample of one of the colored aluminum sticks for us to try and I'm so glad he did. I was hesitant to purchase an aluminum stick because I thought it might be hollow and cheap looking- it isn't at all! These are nicely made and weighted and my daughter has asked for more of the aluminum sticks in a variety of colors so I am back to place another order. I wanted to take the time to leave a review because not only is the product pretty, well made and arrived fast,  but I also appreciate the thoughtfulness of the seller and the way he conducts business with integrity.

The nail stands have a good magnetic pull and fit perfectly in a nail lamp with a bottom attached. The fingers were a hard plastic and were about the size of my pinkie. I expected that from reading the reviews for all different brands though. I haven't used the fingers yet, so I don't know how well they work, but I know from other reviews I'll need to file the nail part to get a good adhesion first. The nail stand works great but I don't love the silver color, it looks cheap and will probably chip off quickly. I'd prefer black or white instead but that wasn't an option with this bundle but it's not a deal breaker here. My only complaint is that the nail stands are very narrow and they tip over one the sides so easily as I put the stand in and out of the uv/led lamp. It's smudged a couple nails in the process. If the base was slightly wider at the bottom it would not be able to tip. I'll probably just hot glue them to something sturdy and flat since almost all those types of stands are like that anyways.

The silicone strips did adhere better so I didn\u2019t have to tease the roots of my hair so much.

It's good, and not hard to do, but takes a bit of time to prepare. So I bought these compressed sheet masks for doing quick lotion masks. I really like these. The compressed size makes it easy to travel with them, and they don't take up hardly any space when you store them. When you get them wet, they expand like the snake pellets you get on 4th of July. =)<br />I keep a shot glass in my bathroom just for doing quick lotion masks. I unwrap one of these compressed masks, toss it in the shot glass, then douse it with skin conditioner, hyaluronic acid lotion, and a bit of rose water. Once the mask is nice and saturated, I put it on my face for 3-5 minutes. (Since I like to listen to music while I'm getting ready, I leave the mask on for about the length of a song.)<br />The cotton material feels nice, not scratchy. When the sheet is wet it has enough stretch to cling to the face like it should. The fit is wide, the the nose flap is short. At least that's the fit on my face. I fix this by carefully cutting the excess width at my temples with scissors and placing one of strips I've cut over the end of my nose where the nose flap doesn't cover. The main thing I like about these is that the flaps on the eye holes are attached at the top. So, while I'm wearing the sheet mask, I can put the eye flaps on my eye lids so they get some moisture and still see what I'm doing. I really like that.<br />I plan on repurchasing these as soon as I run out.", "images": [], "asin": "B01D4EFHUQ", "parent_asin": "B01D4EFHUQ", "user_id": "AGQKYMMKNX4P62RPLDGQIWPAZD3Q", "timestamp": 1519151498941, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

I have been using this facial wash for about 2 weeks now. I notices a BIG difference within 2 days. I also noticed my face didn't have these little biting sensations, which I get on my scalp and arms. I used it on my arms and the biting went away. I have used this in conjunction with OVANTE SHAMPOO. I used the shampoo 2x/day for 5 days and man has it done a wonderful job. The smell isn't that great but I don't care...it's not terrible and it's obviously killing the mites. Be careful to not use any other moisturizers because it clogs your pores. I only use moisturizer on my neck, chin and forehead now.  I have also just started using a Tea Tree Oil body wash. It seems to help. I can't believe my doctor never mentioned this stuff....it works better than the Rx for me. I know not 1 thing works for everyone but I was getting Rosacea postules and redness on nose and cheeks so bad. Not anymore...it has been cleared up.  I do watch what triggers my rosacea...chocolate and alcohol. But using this facial wash has helped so I can have a little of chocolate and alcohol without having terrible redness the next morning.

It can actually be customized by if you use it right out of the package with a dewy finish or turn the sponge over for a more matte finish.  I was disappointed with the color to be honest.  I had heard Korean face makeup was a lot lighter than the ones here in the states but I've found them to just be a tad too dark still for me.  This one was actually a lot darker than some of the other ones and much warmer, but I can still get away with it.  In all honestly this would be a great foundation then for most people who want to try Korean BB cushions because of the color so I highly recommend!  All I did was put in my usual white foundation mixer and now it's perfect.<br /><br />The cushion case itself is actually the best part and I plan to use it long after the foundation itself is used up.<br /><br />I took off a star because of the fragrance.  I must admit for someone with as sensitive skin as I do I can still wear this without irritation so I still recommend it for people with skin like mine.  However, if you're also sensitive to scents as I am, then I wouldn't recommend.  It's actually rather light compared to other Korean products that are heavily perfumed, but still has a perfume scent.  I'm actually quite disappointed that Korean beauty companies choose to put such fake perfume scents into their products and hinders me from using most.

After some weeks of using it I noticed, in retrospect, that the deodorants with aluminum caused me to smell worse when sweating. This deodorant doesn't stop you from sweating, so this was something I had to get used to, and some people might want to consider. I am someone who sweats a lot, regardless nateur keeps me smelling good during the day. However, after a hike of 8 miles I did have to reapply. That for me is reasonable. Also, if I'm under lots of stress I keep it in my bag to reapply during the day. Until now, I have to only reapply it once during the day, if I sweat too much. To some of you that might get some rash on the armpits. In my experience, I got some rash during my second or third week of use, but it went away without me doing anything about it. Everyone is different though. I would say that this deodorant can leave a clear residue on the part of your garments close to the armpits. This has been of no problem to me as it goes away easily. When it happens on my cotton blouses, I hand wash the spot and goes away like nothing with light scrubbing. Even with this in consideration I find the performance of the deodorant exceptional. It keeps me smelling good better than any other deodorant I have tried be it all natural or with aluminum.

The hair was wrapped  with the pink paper which says &#34;Unprocessed Virgin Human Hair&#34;.

The sun screen aspect provides broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection through a physical agent zinc oxide not a chemical agent; further, the zinc oxide used are non-nano sized at about 600nm and the Badger website provides a chart showing the size distributions of their ZnO particles.<br />--- USAGE ---<br />In terms of usage, I have been using this every other day for about a week. It glides on smoothly and has a light pleasant fragrance. It makes my skin feel soft and does not make my face whitish at all.<br />--- EFFECTIVENESS ---<br />I have not been exposed to the sun for more than 20 minutes at a time yet while having this product on my face. Will try to update review once I have more data.<br /><br />I am slightly concerned with the relatively low SPF (16) compared to other daily sunscreens hence the 4 stars. But at the same time I did not want to have loads of sunscreen agents pasted on my face all day. So it's a trade-off.<br /><br />Another product that may be promising with higher SPF (30) is Suntegrity Skincare All Natural Moisturizing Face Protection.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Works on psoriasis!", "text": "Bare with me as I tell my life's story on why I picked this product. I promise reading the whole thing might help you make an informed decision. I did some research before purchasing this soap because the psoriasis by my eyes had been increasingly getting worse. My skin was red, sensitive, flaking, and cracking open. My psoriasis had also been spreading into my cheeks and forehead from around my eyes. I have had eczema in my scalp since I was an infant, which turned into psoriasis, as an adult. I have it on my hands too. The dermatologists prescribed medications weren't working to my satisfaction. I decided to order a bunch of different dead sea salt products to test the one that would work best for me. Dead sea salt, based on my research, can help with the inflammation and dead skin.<br /><br />Now to the review on this particular product:<br />Out of the sea salt scrub (tried it and I'm still on the fence) and mud mask (I haven't tried it yet), this soap bar is my favorite. It works!! I have to say bar, as in one, because so far I'm still working on using the dead sea salt/mud soap bar. If the other bars work equally as well, then this bundle soap is the best deal that I have found. I used the soap bar everyday for a week and I saw significant decreases in all the aforementioned symptoms. I don't have pictures because I'm embarrassed on how badly my psoriasis made my face look. The first week I had a pimple flair up, I think that's pretty normal when using a new product. As far as I know, this company doesn't have moisturizers. My recommendation if you use this soap on psoriasis, get a decent moisturizer too. The soap helps but it leaves the skin a little dry. It's not a bad thing. It just makes your face feel tight. I usually wash my face using the soap before I go to bed. I can then apply a moisturizer in the morning to help with my dry skin. I hope if you choose to purchase this product, that it works for you like it did for me. If you have psoriasis, don't give up and keep trying. Do some research on your skins needs before purchasing any product!", "images": [], "asin": "B07HY7WRVK", "parent_asin": "B07HY7WRVK", "user_id": "AGDT6ZSM76XZA2YH7SAMDHSFNKRA", "timestamp": 1591580699889, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Splat vs. MP", "text": "Ok. So let me start by saying that until last month I had virgin hair. I went to a professional stylist to get my tips dyed rainbow colors. He used 3 different brands. One had stayed in nicely, the other two washed out in one wash with color safe shampoo and I was left with bleached tips and some random blue strands. So I decided to do it myself. I read all the reviews for both splat and Manic Panic and the tips from people who had used them before purchasing 4 colors of Splat and 2 colors of Manic Panic. I used splat beach however because there were several tips that my stylist had left untouched. I have black hair and the bleach lightened it to a medium blonde in about an hour (I wrapped the tips in tin foil to keep it off my skin) plus it didn't fry my hair! I then colored chunks of hair in random order using all 6 dyes. I wrapped the tips in tin foil again, put a plastic bag over my head and waited 3 hours. After removing the tin foil and washing my hair in cold water (which ran clear after 5 minutes at the most) I towel dryed my hair (the towel wasn't stained) and lo and behold. All the splat colors were vibrant and beautiful and one of the MP colors didn't even turn out. Those chunks are still bleach blonde. I love this stuff.<br />Now then. A few things to note. Even with 6 color packets on my counter I didn't make a mess. Nothing got stained. Nothing dripped. I just used latex gloves and a whole lotta patience. The stuff is pretty thick so if you're careful you can do this without staining your forehead :)", "images": [], "asin": "B001540XWK", "parent_asin": "B001540XWK", "user_id": "AG4QFRQOBDUGT5X3VCSQ72ZBC6DA", "timestamp": 1348508439000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Great Shave", "text": "First off let me start off by saying that like most 17 year old males, I have very sensitive skin.  Before buying the Norelco Advantage, I could not find a simple solution to getting a nice quick shave without all the hassle that comes along with it.  I did not really have a problem at the time, with the length of time that shaving took, but rather, the razor-burn afterwards.  I went through about 10-12 different types of creams, and 6-7 different razors, trying to find the right combination.  It wasn't until a good friend of mine recommended this, that I decided to try an electric razor.  The Norelco definately lived up to it's reputation, as one of the best electric razors out there.  Two things that stuck out about it was that you could get a good clean shave in hardly any time at all, and in my case, the gel worked wonders on my previous razor burn.<br /><br />Now, there are however a few things that could have been improved on.  None of these however seriously demote the quality of this razor.  The first thing that I noticed is that it is not good with multiple day stubble.  If I go for a few days without shaving, I end up having to switch to the beard trimmer, and then back again to the regular blade, in order to get a good shave.  This can get quite tedious and annoying in a hurry.  Another thing that I noticed is that the blades tend to gunk up quite easily making cleaning almost a weekly thing.  The last thing is that unless at full charge, the blades tend miss some of the longer hairs.<br /><br />All around this is a great product for those of you out there who are looking for a nice quick close shave.  Dollar for dollar this is one of the better products that I have bought, but I look foward to seeing an upgrade on this Electric.", "images": [], "asin": "B00009RB16", "parent_asin": "B00009RB16", "user_id": "AGVSQDLWVW2FPZX4Q7DUYVNLKFFQ", "timestamp": 1101111811000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I received the 1050 as a gift by the way and I would have never purchased this product based on the generally negative reviews and the obnoxious price tag. It seems like Norelco has spent a great deal of effort making the 1050 look good, but not necessarily function well. Putting the moronic charger design aside (the shaver nestles deep into the charger jacket and there is no easy way of clawing it out without hurting your finger tips), the blades and motor itself seem to lack enough power to perform a basic shave. Dont have time to shave for a day or two? Minor stubble will often lead to snagging, causing a great deal of pain and discomfort. The jaw line and neck require numerous passes to shave, which causes lots of irritation by the end of the shave. Same goes for the sideburn trimmer, which is difficult to use since it so close to the head (difficult to see where the blades are) and it severely underperforms.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "WHAT IS THIS VOODOO?", "text": "Firstly, I RARELY review products... because I'm lazy, what can I say.  HOWEVER, this product could not go without one.<br /><br />Come along for the ride.<br /><br />Recently, I lost a lot of hair due to anxiety and grief.  It was like adding insult to injury when finally I noticed how profound it really was.  I used to have very full, healthy hair and though I have highlights, I take very good care of it - heat protectants, salon shampoo/conditioner... you get the gist.  I had been using \"It's a 10 Silk Express\" thinking it had heat protectant properties like the regular \"It's a 10\" but nay nay!!  For 2-3 months I had been using a curling iron with no protectant!  However, since I don\u2019t curl my hair often I\u2019ve never seen this kind of breakage so what was going on?!  I knew the leave in wasn\u2019t doing me any favors so I looked to my curling iron. I raise the clamp on it and noticed that it had burned completely through it's tourmaline coating underneath - in other words, the temperature control was jacked and getting way too hot. (FU Hosan curling iron that I bought on Amazon).  I never noticed because how often do you look underneath the clamp?  My nearly all one length hair down to the the middle of my back now had several pieces 3-4\" long and some areas even less. To top it off, my hair was now incredibly dry and damaged.  To say I was devastated would be a MASSIVE understatement.<br /><br />In an attempt at damage control I set about trying to find something that would tame the frizz, make my hair soft, and would be healthy for my scalp.  I will tell you I tried SEVERAL products and spent so much $$ in doing so only to have my fine hair feel weighed down or still a matted, dry mess.  Joico Defy Damage Mask, Redken, Olaplex... none of them helped.  Then I stumbled upon this product.  Truth be told, I wasn't looking for it.  I read a review online about a peppermint shampoo that was really good and would leave my hair feeling soft.  (They say peppermint can help with trying to grow hair as it invigorates the scalp and increases blood flow to the follicles.)  I was skeptical but was willing to give it a shot.  THEN, I see this as a \"products you might also need\" and I was like, oh heck, why not.<br /><br />My shampoo and mask arrive and first thing, I'm in the shower trying them out.  Shampoo?  Awesome.  Mask?  UNFREAKINBELIEVABLE!  I was finally able to comb through my hair without a million snags.  OK... what?!  I let my air dry and let me tell you what, my hair is soooo soft!!  I no longer look like Medusa with all the various hair lengths and NO frizz!  This stuff is magic!  And when you compare it to all the other spendy crap I bought, this stuff easily blows them out of the water.... for so much less.  Cherry on top?  It's from a small business from TX!

The third thing is it was hard to use at first as I had no idea what I was doing, but once I got going these were really easy to use. The only thing I wish I did differently is keep the curlers in a little bit longer, use hairspray, and don\u2019t brush the curls out. Also some of the reviews said they were missing clips.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "It also works better if you have soaked your feet for a bit ...", "text": "This was a little bit taken back in experiencing the way this works because I have never used a motorized file and to me, it seemed  temperamental.  You can't press down or the rotation stops, so you have to apply it gently and with a light handed touch.  (I guess it is just a matter to getting used to how to use this.)  Perhaps this is the way due to safety - it lessens the possibility of deep or severe abrasions? Or  Maybe that is just the physics of friction and a safety feature.<br /><br />Applying it gently and lightly is the key.  It also works better if you have soaked your feet for a bit to soften thick callused areas.  At that point though, when you use this device after soaking, be sure to not leave it on a section for more than a few seconds per pass.  Definitely use a foot moisturizer after use, by doing so, the areas I treated were softer and smoother.<br /><br />It DOES work, but it will take a few uses to truly get rid of thick calluses- it does smooth them and diminish the size, but certainly, it does not rid them in one treatment.  The first time I used it on my feet, I only had about five minutes to do this, and it did remove some dead skin (not all) and smoothed out calluses.  My guess is that with repeated use (as in two or three times a week), the appearance of my feet will be better and softer.  It is better than a pumice stone mechanized by your hand as the effort is less with a motorized device.  The roller on this device is akin to a pumice stone, so the roller not flimsy.  I have not tried other ones like this to compare this to them.  This model package came with an additional roller AND batteries.  Keep the clear cover for the roller - for more hygienic storage.  It is waterproof, so the roller was easy to wash off between uses.<br /><br />I might update this after a few more treatments.  Overall, I am not disappointed - the price is better than the others, the roller is decent, and I guess I was hoping it would rid of calluses in one treatment.", "images": [], "asin": "B00Q1BNG6C", "parent_asin": "B00Q1BNG6C", "user_id": "AE3KZJIDRV43DC3FORLAXPSU2CMQ", "timestamp": 1420849226000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}
